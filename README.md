# BinaryTree_AVLBinaryTree_HashTableOpenAddressing  

This project implements three data structures, a Binary Tree, an AVL Binary Tree and an Open Addressing Hash Table.  
The program tests the performance of these data structures using the words in "small-file.txt".  
First, we add every word in the "small-file.txt" in all three data structures and while doing that we also keep 5000 words in order to search for them later.  
Next, we search for the 5000 words in all three data structures, we print how many times each word appears in each data structure and also we record how much time in total each one needs to respond.
